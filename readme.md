# ðŸ‘‰ Tap My Finger
Use this PS1 file in your profile to get updates from users via Finger and check on their status automatically

## Commands
There are a handful of commands in this script. 

### Finger-Someone
Fingers a users account and stores any nwe content within `~\fingered\user@host`

### Tap-Someone
Adds a user to your finger subscriptions stored in `~\fingered\taplist.csv`
returns the content of your tap list (maybe it shouldn't do that?)

### Check-Taps
Queries your TapList and Fingers users in the list. Returns objects containing User and Content properties. Content is the full path name of any newly created archives. Use `get-content` to pull the content into your terminal

example `Get-Content (Check-Taps)[0].Content`
example `Check-Taps | % {Get-Content $_.Content}`
example `$newContent = Check-Taps; Write-Host "You have $($newContent.Count) new messages on tap."`

## Using Tap My Finger
you can dot source this file within your powershell profile to gain access to its commands (maybe one day I'll make this a module).

dot source example: `. .\tapmyfinger.ps1`
